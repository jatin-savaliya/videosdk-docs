### onRecordingStateChanged

- This event will be triggered when the meeting's recording status changed.
- This event can be subscribed from the `useMeeting` hook.

### Example

Here is the usage of the event mentioned in this page.

```javascript
import { Constants, useMeeting } from "@videosdk.live/react-sdk";

function onRecordingStateChanged(data) {
  const { status } = data;

  if (status === Constants.recordingEvents.RECORDING_STARTING) {
    console.log("Meeting Recording is starting");
  } else if (status === Constants.recordingEvents.RECORDING_STARTED) {
    console.log("Meeting Recording is started");
  } else if (status === Constants.recordingEvents.RECORDING_STOPPING) {
    console.log("Meeting Recording is stopping");
  } else if (status === Constants.recordingEvents.RECORDING_STOPPED) {
    console.log("Meeting Recording is stopped");
  } else {
    //
