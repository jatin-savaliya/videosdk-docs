# Speaker Indication - React

Speaker indication feature in VideoSDK let you know, which participant in a meeting is active speaker.

Whenever any participant speaks in meeting, `onSpeakerChanged` event will trigger.

For example, the meeting is running with **Alice** and **Bob**. Whenever any of them speaks, `onSpeakerChanged` event will trigger and return the speaker `participantId`.

### speaker-changed Event

```js
import { useMeeting } from "@videosdk.live/react-sdk";

const MeetingView = () => {
  /** useMeeting hooks events */
  const {
    /** Methods */
  } = useMeeting({
    onSpeakerChanged: (activeSpeakerId) => {
      console.log("participantId", activeSpeakerId);
    },
  });
};
```
