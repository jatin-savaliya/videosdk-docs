# Leave or End Meeting - React

Participant can choose to leave the meeting without removing all the other participants. This is typically done by `Leave Meeting`.

Alternatively, if the participant is the host or the last person remaining in the session, they can choose `End Meeting` by removing all other participants, which will end the session for everyone.

### `leave()`

To leave the meeting without removing all the participant you need to call `leave()` which is the part of the `useMeeting` hook of React SDK.

### `end()`

To leave the meeting by removing all the participant you need to call `end()` which is the part of the `useMeeting` hook of React SDK.

:::note
This methods can be called after the meeting is joined successfully.
:::

#### Example

```jsx
import { useMeeting } from "@videosdk.live/react-sdk";

const MeetingView = () => {
  //Getting the leave and end method from hook and assigning event callbacks
  //highlight-start
  const { leave, end } = useMeeting({
    onMeetingLeft,
    onParticipantLeft,
  });
  //highlight-end

  const handleLeaveMeeting = () => {
    // Leaving Meeting
    //highlight-next-line
    leave();
  };

  const handleEndMeeting = () => {
    // Ending Meeting
    //highlight-next-line
    end();
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleLeaveMeeting}>Leave Meeting</button>
      <button onClick={handleEndMeeting}>End Meeting</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

:::tip
You should call the `leave()` method on the unmount of your main meeting component so that meeting is left once the view is unmounted.
:::
