# Overview

This feature allows participant for establishing connection and getting information from other meetings. Also, a participant will have basic control over other running meetings.

For example, there are two meetings running parallelly **Meeting A** and **Meeting B**, in case one of the participant from **Meeting A** wants to access information of **Meeting B** without joining it, now this can be achieved by establishing connection between meetings, so that participants of **Meeting A** and **Meeting B** will get all the updates from each other.

For This feature, we introduce three new entities/classes :

1. [Connection](/react-native/guide/video-and-audio-calling-api-sdk/features/connection/overview#1-connection)
2. [ConnectionMeeting](/react-native/guide/video-and-audio-calling-api-sdk/features/connection/overview#2-connectionmeeting)
3. [ConnectionParticipants](/react-native/guide/video-and-audio-calling-api-sdk/features/connection/overview#3-connectionparticipants)

### 1. Connection
