# Custom Audio Track - React Native

We have introduced the ability to pass a custom Audio track for the Audio of the participants. This feature can be used to add custom layers like background noise removal, echo cancellation, etc. on audio and send it to other participants.

## Creating a Custom Audio Track

- You can create a Audio Track using `createMicrophoneAudioTrack()` method of `@videosdk.live/react-native-sdk`.
- This method can be used to create audio track using different encoding parameters and noise cancellation configuration.

### Parameters

- **microphoneId**:

  - type: `String`
  - required: `false`
  - It will be the id of the mic from which the audio should be captured.

- **encoderConfig**:

  - type: `String`
  - required: `false`
  - default: `speech_standard`
  - Allowed values : `speech_low_quality` | `speech_standard` | `music_standard` | `standard_stereo` | `high_quality` | `high_quality_stereo`
  - It will be the encoder configuration you want to use for Audio Track.

- **noiseConfig**

  - **echoCancellation**

    - type: `boolean`
    - required: `false`
    - If `true` echo cancellation will turned on else it would be turned off.

  - **autoGainControl**

    - type: `boolean`
    - required: `false`
    - If `true` auto gain will turned on else it would be turned off.

  - **noiseSuppression**
    - type: `boolean`
    - required: `false`
    - If `true` noise suppression will turned on else it would be turned off.

#### Returns

- `MediaStream`

### Example

```javascript
import { createMicrophoneAudioTrack } from "@videosdk.live/react-native-sdk";

let customTrack = await createMicrophoneAudioTrack({
  encoderConfig: "high_quality",
  noiseConfig: {
    noiseSuppression: true,
    echoCancellation: true,
    autoGainControl: true,
  },
});
```

## Using Custom Audio Track

### Custom Track while initializing the meeting

If you are passing `micEnabled: true` in the `config` of `MeetingProvider` and want to use custom tracks from start of the meeting, you can pass custom track in the `config` as shown below.

```javascript
import {
  createMicrophoneAudioTrack,
  MeetingProvider,
} from "@videosdk.live/react-native-sdk";

function App() {
  const getTrack = async () => {
    const track = await await createMicrophoneAudioTrack({
      encoderConfig: "high_quality",
      noiseConfig: {
        noiseSuppression: true,
        echoCancellation: true,
        autoGainControl: true,
      },
    });
    setCustomTrack(track);
  };

  let [customTrack, setCustomTrack] = useState();

  useEffect(() => {
    getTrack();
  }, []);

  return (
    customTrack && (
      <MeetingProvider
        config={{
          meetingId,
          micEnabled: true, //If true, it will use the passed custom track to turn mic on
          webcamEnabled: true,

          //Pass the custom audio track here
          customMicrophoneAudioTrack: customTrack,
        }}
        token={token}
        reinitialiseMeetingOnConfigChange={true}
        joinWithoutUserInteraction={true}
      >
        <MeetingView />
      </MeetingProvider>
    )
  );
}
```

### Custom Track with `unmuteMic()`

In order to switch tracks during the meeting, you have to pass the `MediaStream` in the `unmuteMic()` method of `useMeeting`.

You can also pass custom track in `toggleMic()` method of `useMeeting`.

:::note

Make sure to call `muteMic()` before you create a new track as it may lead to unexpected behavior.

:::

```javascript
import {
  createMicrophoneAudioTrack,
  useMeeting,
} from "@videosdk.live/react-native-sdk";

let customTrack = await createMicrophoneAudioTrack({
  encoderConfig: "high_quality",
  noiseConfig: {
    noiseSuppression: true,
    echoCancellation: true,
    autoGainControl: true,
  },
});

const { unmuteMic, toggleMic } = useMeeting();

unmuteMic(customTrack);

//or

toggleMic(customTrack);
```
