# Leave or End Meeting - React Native

Whenever participant wishes to end their communication in the meeting, they can simply leave the meeting.

This guide will provide an overview of how to implement leave or end feature in VideoSDK meetings.

1. **Leave** - By using `leave()` function, only a participant will leave/exit the meeting, the rest of the meeting will continue with other participants.

2. **End** - By using `end()` function, meeting will end for each and every participant. So, use this function according to your use cases.

### Leave And End Meeting

```js
import { useMeeting } from "@videosdk.live/react-native-sdk";

const MeetingView = () => {
  const { leave, end } = useMeeting();

  const onPress = () => {
    // Leave Meeting
    leave();
    // Exit Meeting
    end();
  };

  return <>...</>;
};
```

### Events

**Events associated with `leave()`:**

- Local participant will receive a callback on[`onMeetingLeft`](../../../api/sdk-reference/use-meeting/events#onmeetingleft) of `useMeeting()` hook.
- All remote participants will receive a callback [`onParticipantLeft`](../../../api/sdk-reference/use-meeting/events#onparticipantleft) with Participant object.

**Event associated with `end()`:**

- All remote participants and local participant will receive a callback on [`onParticipantLeft`](../../../api/sdk-reference/use-meeting/events#onparticipantleft) with Participant object.

```js
function onParticipantLeft(participant) {
  console.log(" onParticipantLeft", participant);
}

function onMeetingLeft() {
  console.log("onMeetingLeft");
}


const {
  meetingId
  ...
} = useMeeting({
  onMeetingLeft,
  onParticipantLeft,
  ...
});
```
