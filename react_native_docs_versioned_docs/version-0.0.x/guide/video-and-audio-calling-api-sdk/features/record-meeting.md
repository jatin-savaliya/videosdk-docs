# Record Meeting

Record meeting allows participants to record video & audio during the meeting. The recording files are available in developer dashboard.
Any participant can start / stop recording any time during the meeting.

This guide will provide an overview of how to implement start and stop Meeting Recording.

1. **Start Recording** - By using `startRecording()` function, a participant can start meeting recording.

2. **Stop Recording** - By using `stopRecording()` function, a participant can stop meeting recording.

### Start And Stop Recording

```js
import { useMeeting } from "@videosdk.live/react-native-sdk";

const MeetingView = () => {
  const { startRecording, stopRecording } = useMeeting();

  const onPress = () => {
    // Start Recording
    startRecording(webhookUrl, awsDirPath);

    // Stop Recording
    stopRecording();
  };
  return <>...</>;
};
```

### Events

1. **recording-started** - Whenever any participant start meeting recording, then `recording-started` event will trigger.

2. **recording-stopped** - Whenever any participant stop meeting recording, then `recording-stopped` event will trigger.

3. **recording-state-changed** - Whenever meeting recording state changes, then `recording-state-changed` event will trigger.

```js
import { Constants, useMeeting } from "@videosdk.live/react-native-sdk";

function onRecordingStateChanged(data) {
  const { status } = data;

  if (status === Constants.recordingEvents.RECORDING_STARTING) {
    console.log("Meeting recording is starting");
  } else if (status === Constants.recordingEvents.RECORDING_STARTED) {
    console.log("Meeting recording is started");
  } else if (status === Constants.recordingEvents.RECORDING_STOPPING) {
    console.log("Meeting recording is stopping");
  } else if (status === Constants.recordingEvents.RECORDING_STOPPED) {
    console.log("Meeting recording is stopped");
  } else {
    //
  }
}

/** useMeeting hooks events */
const {
  /** Methods */
} = useMeeting({
  onRecordingStarted: () => {
    console.log("Recording Started");
  },
  onRecordingStopped: () => {
    console.log("Recording Stopped");
  },
  onRecordingStateChanged,
});
```
