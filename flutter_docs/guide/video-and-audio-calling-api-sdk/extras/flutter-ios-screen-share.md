# Share screen - Flutter iOS

iOS requires you to add an Broadcast Upload Extension to capture the screen to the device.

:::note

Flutter iOS screenshare is available from the SDK version 1.0.5 and above and the deployment target for iOS app should be **iOS 14 or newer**
:::

## Create Broadcast Upload Extension in iOS

### Step 1 : Open Target

Open your project with xcode, select **File > New > Target** in menu bar.

Now, broadcast folder will appear in xcode left side bar.

### Step 5 : Add External file in Created Extension

Open [videosdk-rtc-flutter-sdk-example](https://github.com/videosdk-live/videosdk-rtc-flutter-sdk-example/tree/main/ios/FlutterBroadcast), Copy `SampleUploader.swift`, `SocketConnection.swift`, `DarwinNotificationCenter.swift`, and `Atomic.swift` files to your extension's folder and make sure they're added to the target.

### Step 6 : Update `SampleHandler.swift` file

Open [SampleHandler.swift](https://github.com/videosdk-live/videosdk-rtc-flutter-sdk-example/blob/main/ios/FlutterBroadcast/SampleHandler.swift) and Copy `SampleHandler.swift` file content and paste it to your extensions `SampleHandler.swift` file.

### Step 7 : Add Capability in App

In Xcode, go to **YourappName > Signing & Capabilities**. and click on **+Capability** to configure app group.

Select **App Groups** from list

After that, you have to select or add generated app group id which you have created before.

### Step 8 : Add Capability in Extension

Go to **Your-Extension-Name > Signing & Capabilities** and configure **App Group** functionality which we had perform in previous steps. (Group id should be same for both targets)

![IOS Screen Share](/img/ios-screenshare/step11-xcode.png)

### Step 9 : Add App Group Id in Extension File

Go to extensions `SampleHandler.swift` file and paste your group Id in `appGroupIdentifier` constant.

![IOS Screen Share](/img/ios-screenshare/step12-xcode.png)

### Step 10 : Update App level info.plist file

1.  Add a new key **RTCScreenSharingExtension** in Info.plist with the extension's Bundle Identifier as the value.
2.  Add a new key **RTCAppGroupIdentifier** in Info.plist with the extension's App groups Id as the value.

**Note** : For extension's Bundle Identifier, go to **TARGETS > Your-Extension-Name > Signing & Capabilities** .

## Enable Screen Share

- In order to start screen-sharing just call `room.enableScreenShare()` method.

```js
ElevatedButton(
    child: Text("Start ScreenSharing"),
    onPressed: () {
        room.enableScreenShare();
    },
),
```

![IOS Screen Share](/img/ios-screenshare/step23-xcode.png)

After clicking **Start Broadcast** button, we wiil be able to get the screen stream in session.

## Disable Screen Share

By using `room.disableScreenShare()` function, a participant can stop publishing screen stream to other participants.

```js
ElevatedButton(
    child: Text("Stop ScreenSharing"),
    onPressed: () {
        room.disableScreenShare();
    },
),
```
