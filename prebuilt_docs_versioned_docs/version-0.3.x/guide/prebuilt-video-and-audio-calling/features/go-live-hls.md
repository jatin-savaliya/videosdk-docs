# Go Live On HLS - Prebuilt

HLS allows participant to broadcast live streaming to other participants.
This guide will provide an overview of how participant can start and stop broadcasting meeting.

### HLS attributes

- `mode`: It should be any of `VIEWER` or `CONFERENCE`, by default is set to `CONFERENCE`
- `toggleHLS` : When set to `true` it will enable you to click on `Start HLS` button.
- `hls.enabled` : When set to `true` , you can see `Start HLS` button.
- `hls.autoStart`: If it is `true` then HLS will start automatically when the meeting starts, default value is false (You can't start HLS during the meeting).
- `hls.theme`: It will HLS the meeting based on theme you are passing. it can be a either DARK , LIGHT or DEFAULT.
- `hls.playerControlsVisible` : If it is `true` then participant can view controls for the interactive meeting player.
- `toggleParticipantMode`: When set to `true`, you can toggle other partcipant mode from an ongoing meeting by clicking on `Add as a Cohost` Icon button.

:::note

`hls.playerControlsVisible` parameter will only work if the mode is set to `viewer`, for `conference` mode there will not be any interactive meeting player hence `hls.playerControlsVisible` will be ignored if mode is set to `conference`.

## Better Understanding of Modes

### 1. CONFERENCE Mode

This mode is default mode if you do not give any mode, it will look similar as a normal meeting. when you pass `hls.enabled` true you can see `Start HLS` button. if you want to toggle the button then in `permission` config pass other parameter `toggleHLS` true so you can toggle button.

In `CONFERENCE` mode you can toggle other participant mode also. like you can add other participant as a co-host. for that you need to pass parameter `toggleParticipantMode` true in `permission` config.

You can click on more button to see add as co-host icon.

    //  ...other permissions
    toggleParticipantMode: true,
    toggleHls: true,
  },

};
```
