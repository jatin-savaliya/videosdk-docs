# Mic Controls - Prebuilt

Different mic control permissions allows participant to enable/disable their own mic and other participant's mic too & also can set default participant's mic settings, when meeting start.

### How it works ?

- While `participantCanToggleSelfMic` value is set to `true`, you can enable/disable your own mic as display in below image.

- While `participantCanToggleSelfMic` value is set to `false`, the below mic button will not appear.

### Mic Attributes

- `micEnabled`: Default mic setting for meeting joinee, true enables mic & false disable mic.
- `participantCanToggleSelfMic`: Allow participant to enable/disable their own mic.

```js title="index.html"
const config = {
  // ...
  micEnabled: true,
  participantCanToggleSelfMic: true,
  // ...
};
```
