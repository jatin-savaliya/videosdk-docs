# Record Meeting - Prebuilt

Record meeting allows participants to record video & audio during the meeting. The recording files are available in customer dashboard.
Any participant can start/stop recording any time during the meeting.

### How it works ?

- While `recordingEnabled` value is set to `true`, you will show recording button as display in below image.

- While `recordingEnabled` value is set to `false`, the below recording button will not appear.

### Recording Attributes

- `recordingEnabled`: If it is true, then recording button will be visible on top bar of the meeting. If it is false, then recording button won't be available on top bar of the meeting.
- `toggleRecording`: If it is true, then other participant can start/stop recording during the meeting. If it is false, then participant can not start/stop recording during the meeting.
- `recordingWebhookUrl`: It's your [webhook url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook), where we notify once meeting recording is complete.
- `autoStartRecording`: It will auto start recording when participant joined

```js title="index.html"
const config = {
  // ...
  recordingEnabled: true,
  recordingWebhookUrl: "yourwebsite.com/callback",
  autoStartRecording: true,
  permissions: {
    // ...
    toggleRecording: true, // Can toggle meeting recording
  },
  // ...
};
```
