### Join Screen Attributes

To configure join screen feature, you need to add join screen object in meeting config.

`joinScreen` object has following attributes:

- `visible`: If you want to show join screen before the start of the meeting set it `true `otherwise `false`.

- `title`: Meeting title.
- `meetingUrl`: Meeting join url, where your meeting will be hosted.

```js title="index.html"
const config = {
  // ...
  joinScreen: {
    visible: true,
    title: "Daily scrum",
    meetingUrl: "customURL.com",
  },
  // ...
};
```
