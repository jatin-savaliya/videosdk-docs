This page will keep you update all the releases of Prebuilt SDK.

## v0.2.4

**Release** : January 2022

**Change log** :

Regular layout attributes & Recording/RTMP layout attributes have been changed and separated. This change is offering better flexibility if you want to use different layout settings on both sides.

- **Layout types** : `SPOTLIGHT` | `SIDEBAR` | `GRID` This offers different types of looks.

- **Priority** : `SPEAKER` | `PIN`, This offers you an option to whom you want to give priority on-screen, the active speaker or PINNED speaker.
