# Leave or End Meeting - Flutter

Whenever participant wishes to end their communication in the meeting, they can simply leave the meeting.

This guide will provide an overview of how to implement leave or end feature in VideoSDK meetings.

1. **Leave** - By using `leave()` function, only a participant will leave/exit the meeting, the rest of the meeting will continue with other participants.
2. **End** - By using `end()` function, meeting will end for each and every participant. So, use this function according to your use cases.

### Leave And End Meeting

```js
// Leave the meeting
meeting.leave();

// end() method is coming soon in flutter.
```
