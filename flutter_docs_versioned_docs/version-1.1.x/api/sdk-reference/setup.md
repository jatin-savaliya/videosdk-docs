# Setup

Flutter SDK is client for real-time communication for android and ios devices. It inherits the same terminology as all other SDKs does.

## Minimum OS/SDK versions

Android: minSdkVersion >= 23

<!-- ### IOS: > 11 -->

## Use this package as a library

### Step 1: Add this package in your flutter project

Run this command:

```js
flutter pub add videosdk
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit flutter pub get):

```js
dependencies:
  videosdk: ^1.0.0
```

Alternatively, your editor might support or flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

### Step 2: Import it

Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```js
import "package:videosdk/videosdk.dart";
```
