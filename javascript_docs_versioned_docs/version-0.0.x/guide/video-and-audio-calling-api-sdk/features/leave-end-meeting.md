# Leave or End Meeting - Javascript

Whenever participant wishes to end their communication in the meeting, they can simply leave the meeting.

This guide will provide an overview of how to implement leave or end feature in VideoSDK meetings.

1. **Leave** - By using `leave()` function, only a participant will leave/exit the meeting, the rest of the meeting will continue with other participants.
2. **End** - By using `end()` function, meeting will end for each and every participant. So, use this function according to your use cases.

### Leave And End Meeting

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

```js
const onPress = () => {
  // Leave Meeting
  meeting?.leave();

  // Exit Meeting
  meeting?.end();
};
```

### Events

**Events associated with `leave()`:**

- Local participant will receive a [`meeting-left`](../../../api/sdk-reference/meeting-class/events.md#meeting-left) event.
- All remote participants will receive a [`participant-left`](../../../api/sdk-reference/meeting-class/events.md#participant-left) event with `participantId`.

**Event associated with `end()`:**

- All [participants](../../../api/sdk-reference/participant-class/introduction.md) and [localParticipant](../../../api/sdk-reference/participant-class/introduction.md), will be emitted with [`meeting-left`](../../../api/sdk-reference/meeting-class/events.md#meeting-left) event.

```js
meeting.on("meeting-left", () => {
  //Meeting Left
});

meeting.on("participant-left", (participant) => {
  //Participant Left the meeting
});
```
