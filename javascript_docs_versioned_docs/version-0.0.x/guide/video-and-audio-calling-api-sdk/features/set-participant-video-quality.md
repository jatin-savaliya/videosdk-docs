# Set Video Quality - Javascript

- Set Video Quality feature allows participants to set other participant's video quality during the meeting.

- `Participant` class provides the `setQuality()` method to set participant's video quality.

```js
const participant = meeting.participants.get("PARTICIPANT_ID");

const onPressed = () => {
  // Set low quality
  participant.setQuality("low");
  // Set medium quality
  participant.setQuality("med");
  // Set high quality
  participant.setQuality("high");
};
```

:::note

If the quality is set to high, but there is not enough network bandwidth available, quality will reduce untill the newtwork quality improves.
