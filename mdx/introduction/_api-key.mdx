### Generate Token

To manage secured communication, every participant that connects to a meeting needs an access token. You can easily generate this token by using your `apiKey` and `secret-key`, which you can obtain from the [VideoSDK Dashboard](https://app.videosdk.live/api-keys).

**For development purpose**, you can generate a temporary token from [VideoSDK Dashboard's API section](https://app.videosdk.live/api-keys).

import ReactPlayer from "react-player";

<ReactPlayer
  autoplay
  muted
  loop
  playing
  url="/video/dashboard_token_generation.mp4"
  width={"100%"}
  controls
/>

:::tip
The best practice for obtaining a token involves generating it from your backend server which will help in **keeping your credentials safe**.
