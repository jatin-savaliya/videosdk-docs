### Generate Token

To manage secured communication, every participant that connects to meeting needs a access token. You can easily generate these token by using your `apiKey` and `secret-key` which you can get from [VideoSDK Dashboard](https://app.videosdk.live/api-keys).

**For developement purpose**, you can generate a temporary token from [VideoSDK Dashboard's API section](https://app.videosdk.live/api-keys).

import ReactPlayer from "react-player";

<ReactPlayer
  autoplay
  muted
  loop
  playing
  url="/video/dashboard_token_generation.mp4"
  width={"100%"}
  controls
/>

The best practice for getting token includes you generating it from your backend server which will help in **keeping your credentials safe**.
